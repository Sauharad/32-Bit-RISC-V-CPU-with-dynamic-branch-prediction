**# 32-Bit RISC-V CPU with Dynamic Branch Prediction and Instruction Cache

A Verilog-based, five-stage pipelined RISC-V processor core implementing the RV32I instruction set. The design features dynamic branch prediction using a Branch History Table (BHT) and Branch Target Buffer (BTB), as well as a single-level, set-associative instruction cache. Developed and simulated using AMD Vivado 2024.2.

## Architecture

### Pipeline Design

The processor datapath follows the classic five-stage RISC pipeline:
1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**
3. **Execute (EX)**
4. **Memory Access (MEM)**
5. **Write Back (WB)**

### Hazard Resolution

- **Data hazards** are mitigated using data forwarding units.
- Forwarding logic identifies dependencies and supplies results from later pipeline stages (EX, MEM, WB) directly to the ALU inputs, minimizing stalls.

### Branch Prediction

- **Branch execution** occurs during the **ID stage**, which reduces pipeline delay associated with branches.
- A dedicated branch condition checker and forwarding unit handle operand dependencies specific to branch instructions.

Dynamic branch prediction is achieved using:
- **Branch History Table (BHT)**:
  - Indexed by the lower bits of the Program Counter (PC)
  - Contains 2-bit saturating counters indicating the probability of a branch being taken
- **Branch Target Buffer (BTB)**:
  - 4-way set associative structure
  - Stores predicted target addresses of recent branches
  - If both BHT and BTB indicate a taken branch, the PC is updated with the predicted PC (PPC)

### Instruction Cache

- 4-way set associative design with 32-byte blocks
- Cache access occurs in the IF stage
- On a cache **hit**, the instruction is fetched in a single cycle
- On a **miss**, a cache miss signal is raised, and the appropriate block is requested from instruction memory
- Once updated, instruction fetch proceeds from the cache

## Simulation and Testing

Testing is conducted by manually inserting RISC-V assembly instructions into the instruction memory. Test cases are crafted to:
- Introduce data and control hazards
- Implement loops to test prediction accuracy
- Stress the forwarding and hazard detection mechanisms

Simulation is carried out using AMD Vivadoâ€™s simulation environment. Functional verification is done through waveform analysis to confirm pipeline correctness, proper hazard resolution, and cache behavior.

## Future Work

### Short-Term Goals
- Implementation of a **data cache**
- Integration of a **UART peripheral** for serial I/O

### Long-Term Goals
- Transition to a **superscalar architecture**
- Support for **Out-of-Order execution**
- Expansion of supported instruction sets:
  - **RV32M** (Multiplication and Division)
  - **RV32A** (Atomic operations)
  - **RV32F/D** (Floating-point and Double-Precision)
  - **RV32C** (Compressed instructions)
